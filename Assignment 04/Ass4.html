<h1>Welcome to Nashik!!</h1>
<h3> Name: </h3>
<p>The name of the Nashik has been changing since long time as per different rulers. 
It is believed the name "Nashik" was derived after the incident in Ramayana when Lakshman (Sri Ram's brother) chopped off the nose of Surpanakha (Ravan's sister). <br>
One school of thoughts states that Nashik is combination of nava shikha - nine summits. 
It was also named as Gulshnabad by Muslim rulers which was never adopted by the residents.</p><br>

<p>Nashik is also known in India as a landing city for travelling to Shirdi and Trambakeshwar which hosts one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. 
It is believed that during ancient times, during transportation, the drops of Amrit fell into the Brahma-Kund at Trambakeshwar. 
This makes it one of the most popular religious travel destinations of India.<br> 
Nashik is also known as a transit station for devotees going to Shirdi, residence of Sai Baba (90 Kilometres from Nashik).<br>
Nashik is home to Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha (Kumbh Mela)– a Hindu religious Mela (fair) held every 12 years. It is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbha Melas, and is also known as Nashik-Trimbak Kumbha Mela or Nashik Kumbha Mela. 
The Nashik Kumbh Mela is normally considered to be the most holy celebrations in Hinduism.</p>
